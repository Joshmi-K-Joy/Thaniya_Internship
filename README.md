📌 Overview

This project applies K-Means Clustering to group songs into different musical genres based on their audio features. The dataset used is a Spotify dataset (CSV format) containing various audio characteristics of songs. The analysis and clustering are performed entirely in Jupyter Notebook using Python.


✨ Features

✅ Unsupervised Learning: Uses K-Means clustering to group songs without predefined labels.✅ Feature-Based Clustering: Groups songs based on attributes like tempo, loudness, danceability, and energy.✅ Data Visualization: Uses plots and charts to analyze genre distributions.✅ Spotify Dataset: Real-world dataset containing diverse music metadata.✅ Jupyter Notebook Implementation: Full analysis and clustering executed within Jupyter Notebook.


📂 Dataset: Spotify CSV File

The dataset contains various audio features extracted from Spotify, including:
Danceability,Energy,Loudness,Tempo,Valence (positiveness of a track),Instrumentalness,Speechiness (presence of spoken words)
These features help in clustering songs into similar groups based on their characteristics.


📌Programming Languages & Libraries

Python (Main Programming Language)
Pandas & NumPy (Data Handling)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
Jupyter Notebook (Development Environment)


📊 Results & Analysis

The K-Means model successfully groups songs into clusters based on their audio features. Songs with similar characteristics (e.g., high danceability and tempo) are clustered together, providing valuable insights into music segmentation.


🚀 Future Enhancements

🔹 Improve clustering accuracy using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).🔹 Apply hierarchical clustering for a more structured genre classification.🔹 Incorporate Spotify API to fetch real-time song data.🔹 Enhance visualization with interactive plots.


🏁 Conclusion

This project successfully implements unsupervised music genre clustering using K-Means Clustering. By leveraging audio features from a Spotify dataset, it provides meaningful segmentation of songs based on their musical attributes. The results demonstrate how machine learning can be applied in music analysis to enhance recommendations and playlist categorization.
Future improvements will focus on better clustering techniques, real-time data integration, and advanced visualization. This project lays the foundation for AI-driven music classification and recommendation systems.
